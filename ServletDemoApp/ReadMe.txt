Points to be taken care of while using Servlets:

1. Note: For creation of Servlets we need the servlet-api and that is by default provided by Tomcat and is in the location:
C:\Program Files\Apache Software Foundation\Tomcat 9.0\lib

2. While downloading the Tomcat make sure to download the source code too because that will be helpful to get the 
description of the methods from servlet-api that we will be using in the project.

3. If you don't see the changes made to the servlet file while running the servlet application then make sure to build
the servlet project i.e. Right click on the project > Build project and then right click on the Tomcat server under 
Servers tab > Clean.
